Final Project

# Background
Konane, aka Hawaiian checkers, is a 2 player oppositional game consisting of a gameboard of black and white pieces. Players take turns making a move, where they must jump over/eat their opponent's pieces. To win, one player must create a gameboard where the opponent has no moves left on their turn.

# Goal
Develop an AI gameplaying program that uses heuristics to outperform both human and other AI players. 

# Files Includes
  - game.py: This file is the Game object class. This includes actually running an instance of the game and maintaining all of the instantial details, logic, algorithms, players, etc.
  - gameState.py: This file is the GameState object class, which is used to maintain internal representation of the game board.
  - konane.py: This file is the driver program. Run this file to play the game in the cmd terminal.
